# Number Parsing Code Kata
## Objective
In ```dataA.out.txt```, ```dataB.out.txt``` and ```dataC.out.txt```, we have 1000 numbers stored in grids 10 digits across x 100 digits high. We want to take this poorly-stored data, parse it, and create MD5 hashes from the data.   

There is existing code in ```Parser.java```. It only handles the format of ```dataA.out.txt```, and perhaps has some issues? Give it a shot.

## Running code 
```javac Parser.java && java Parser ./data[A|B|C].out.txt```
